refactor: use CaptureOnConfig model for type-safe capture_on settings

BREAKING CHANGE: capture_on is now a typed model instead of a dict

Changes:
- Create CaptureOnConfig model with typed login_detection and publish boolean fields
- Update DiagnosticsConfig.capture_on to use CaptureOnConfig instead of dict[str, bool]
- Update all code using capture_on to use attribute access (.login_detection, .publish) instead of .get()
- Update validator to work with new model structure
- Update tests to work with new model structure
- Fix unused variable in test file

Benefits:
- Type safety: IDE autocomplete and type checking for capture_on properties
- Schema generation: JSON schema now enumerates known properties instead of using additionalProperties
- Runtime validation: Pydantic validates only known properties are used

Migration:
Old configs using dict-style capture_on will continue to work via Pydantic model validation

Quality gates:
- Format: ✅
- Lint: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 notes  
- Tests: 9 passed (previously failing tests now pass)
