# This file makes the tests/ directory a Python package.
# It is required so that direct imports like 'from tests.conftest import ...' work correctly,
# and to avoid mypy errors about duplicate module names when using such imports.
# Pytest does not require this for fixture discovery, but Python and mypy do for package-style imports.
